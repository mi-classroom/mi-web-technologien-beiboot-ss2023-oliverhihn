# Debugging and Development Environment

## Status

rejected

## Context

After what seemed like a decade of struggling with the [documentation]([documentation](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/#:~:text=on%20the%20Web-,AR.,enhanced%20for%20AR.js%203.4)) I finally have (for the second thime in this project) choosen to give up and change the plan. AR.js seems to not be that straight foreward and simple after all.

## Decision

Trying WebXR as most of the other student doing this project seem to have had success with it.
