# Finding a suitible framework for the demoapp üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

Apart form the framework we need to render the AR view, we also want a framework for the site and navigation itself. Popular frameworks for these kind of applications would be React, Vue or Angular. These frameworks have a big community and with that many support options. Furthermore are there examples for developing an application with AR capabilities already published to the internet.

# Vue.js üñºÔ∏è

[Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) is a progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.

## Status

accepted ‚úÖ

## Context

Vue.js is a very popular framework, making it easier to find help and documentation online. Furthermore it is perfect for single-page applications, which is going to be usefull for our application which is ging to be used out in the wilderness of the OBK where internet connection strength is a scarse ressource.

## Decision

Because of the reasons already mentioned above, Vue.js seems like a good fit for this decision. Also, i already have worked with vue projects and that might help in the implementation process. I am quite sure the other frameworks are also good for this job, but my experience with this framework and the other points mentioned above make it my favorite choice for this project.
