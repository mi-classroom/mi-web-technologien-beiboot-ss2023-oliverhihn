# Choosing the Framework for this Project

Choosing the right framweork is an important decision and therefore noted in form of an ADR.

## Status

accepted âœ…

## Context

There are several good frameworks available for web-based augmented reality (WebAR) development. Here are some of the most popular ones:

A-Frame: A-Frame is an open-source framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences, but it can also be used for WebAR development. It uses HTML and JavaScript, making it easy to get started for web developers. A-Frame also has a large community and offers many resources and examples.

AR.js: AR.js is a lightweight and efficient WebAR framework that uses marker-based AR technology. It is designed to work with a wide range of devices and browsers, and it offers features such as image recognition, tracking, and markerless AR.

Three.js: Three.js is a popular 3D graphics library that can be used for WebAR development. It offers many features for creating 3D models and animations, and it is compatible with A-Frame and other WebAR frameworks.

React 360: React 360 is a framework for building 360-degree VR and AR experiences. It is based on the React JavaScript library, making it easy for web developers to get started. React 360 also offers features such as spatial audio and 3D model support.

Babylon.js: Babylon.js is a powerful 3D game engine that can also be used for WebAR development. It offers many features for creating realistic 3D scenes and animations, and it is compatible with A-Frame and other WebAR frameworks.

## Decision

AR.js seems like a goof framework since the documentations is straight foreward and since it seems simplistic and minimalistic.

## Consequences

Needs three.js
