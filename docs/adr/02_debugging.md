# Debugging and Development Environment

## Status

rejected

## Context

Debugging is important for efficient development even in minimalistic apps like this

## Decision

After houers of googeling and even more hoers of trying to build the firefox WebXR Viewer application to get the debugging capabilities in xcode I finally surrender. It seems like an enrolled developing account is needed to sign the code and build the app for ios. The enrollement coasts 100â‚¬ per year. Not doing this for debugging an application. We continue without propper debugging capabilities as already too much time was wasted here. It would be cheaper to buy an android phone and use it together with the chrome developer thingy...

## Consequences

Development is most likeley going to be frustrating and painful. Just like giving up on this debugging problem. Also, it would all be much easier when this feature was finally released in Safari for ios.
